kirtans collection project

The Satyananda Yoga Bihar Yoga tradition has a great collection of kirtans. I don't know of a single repository that provides
- search by text or tune
- search by deity/energy, auspicious time, or genre
- learn by swara, classical notation, or call/repeat
- karaoke support
- meaning of the kirtan

... so this initiative is born. If you would like to contribute, consider making a (free) GitHub account and filing a feature request (https://github.com/yogaedu-org/kirtan-collection-project/issues/new). More oppotunities for seva on this project will be posted in the coming weeks. You are also invited to join the [https://tiny.cc/ya-kirtan-collection-proj](Kirtan Collection Project) WhatsApp group to receive project updates, announcements, and relevant notifications. 

Can't wait to have a fully functioning kirtan search engine to listen and learn from!
Jai Ho!
