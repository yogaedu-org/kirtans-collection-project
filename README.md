kirtans collection project

The Satyananda Yoga Bihar Yoga tradition has a great collection of kirtans. I don't know of a single repository that provides
- search by text or tune
- search by deity/energy, auspicious time, or genre
- learn by swara, classical notation, or call/repeat
- karioki support
- meaning of the kirtan

so this initiative is born. If you would like to contribute, consider making GitHub account and filing a feature request. More oppotunities for seva on this project will be posted in the coming weeks. 

Can't wait to have a fully functioning kirtan search engine to listen and learn from!
Jai Ho!
